# üß† [Introduction](#introduction)

The **Detention Facility Management System (DFMS)** is a comprehensive digital solution designed to automate and streamline detention operations within government correctional facilities. This project aims to modernize the management of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDL), visitor tracking, and incident logging processes through a centralized, role-based digital platform.
Built specifically for the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency ‚Äì National Capital Region (PDEA-NCR), the system automates critical detention operations including inmate management, visitor tracking, and comprehensive incident reporting. The DFMS facilitates efficient PDL record management, enhances security protocols, and provides data-driven insights for better facility administration.

## üè¶ Case Study: PDEA-NCR Detention Facility Operations

### Current Challenges:

* **Manual PDL Management:** Paper-based inmate records leading to inefficiencies and data inconsistencies
* **Visitor Tracking Issues:** Difficulty in monitoring and logging visitor information systematically
* **Incident Documentation:** Insufficient digital logging of facility incidents and activities
* **Report Generation Delays:** Time-consuming manual compilation of statistics and reports
* **Limited Data Analytics:** Lack of insights from PDL demographics and facility operations
* **Security Concerns:** Risk of data loss and unauthorized access with manual systems

### Proposed Solution:
A centralized digital platform that automates detention facility operations, providing real-time PDL management, visitor tracking, incident logging, and comprehensive reporting capabilities for enhanced security and operational efficiency.
